Note: Poor colour representation in gif, looks way better irl.

### What is an RSVP reader?
RSVP stands for [Rapid Serial Visual presentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_serial_visual_presentation).
Its a controversial method to enable speedreading. I have been using this on my devices, and it has given me great results. I wanted to have an option to do this in the terminal too.

Ignore the haters, and try it for yourself.
Also, I don't like that the best options on a computer are paid softwares.

### Usage
To install, use either 

```pip install shirah-reader```

or

```pip3 install shirah-reader```


To read a book, and set a speed, enter

```shirah /path/to/book```

Here are the shortcuts:
```
Usage:
    shirah             read last epub
    shirah EPUBFILE    read EPUBFILE
    shirah STRINGS     read matched STRINGS from history
    shirah NUMBER      read file from history
                       with associated NUMBER
                       
Options:
    -r              print reading history
    -d              dump epub
    -h, --help      print short, long help
```

### How to speed read
